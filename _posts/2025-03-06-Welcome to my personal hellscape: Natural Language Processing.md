Every friend I have who moves anything heavier than a laptop more 
than twice a week eventually tells me the same old joke.  
> “Bro, you don’t work hard. I just pulled a 4,700-hour week 
> digging a tunnel under Mordor with a toothbrush.”  

Yeah, sure. You’re out there throwing down against gravity and 
entropy itself, dragging your body through the dirt. **Respect.**  
But let’s not get it twisted—while you’re breaking your body, I’m cracking open 
the soft, quivering machinery of the human language – and by 
extension, and abstraction, the human mind.

## Welcome to my personal hellscape: *Natural Language Processing*  

Where meaning gets mangled, logic dissolves into madness, and the 
shape of my brain is twisted into forms it was never meant to hold.  

You see, our squishy biological processors were designed to recognize 
faces, avoid saber-toothed tigers, and maybe remember where the 
best berries grow. They were *not* meant to wrestle with the infinite 
fractal chaos of language—this thing that evolves over hundreds of 
thousands of years as a social coordination mechanism for hairless 
primates, where words and meaning shapeshift across contexts, 
cultures, and centuries.  

Now, we twist it further, compressing it into **mathematical transformations**, 
encoding thought into **tensors and probability distributions.**  

And yet here I am—**taming semantic ambiguity, herding syntactic 
cats, and force-feeding raw data into neural networks** that could 
*(potentially)* hallucinate Shakespeare if I asked them nicely on a 
warm sunny day.

You think lifting weights is hard?  
Try dragging your perception through the bottomless pit of **LLMs**,  
clawing at layers of **abstract thoughts**,  
hours spent **fine-tuning parameters**,  
dancing with **algorithms that spit out nonsense** until—maybe, just maybe—  
they finally whisper something close to coherent.  

And the semantics?  
They slip through your fingers like smoke, leaving you clutching 
meaningless vectors and shattered hopes.  

---

I don’t just write code.  
I **dive into the raw, primal soup of human thought**,  
feeding **colossal language models** on the bones of the internet  
until they spit out answers with the eerie confidence of a drunk oracle.  

These aren’t just words,  
they are **mathematical shadows of meaning**,  
condensed into billions of parameters that hum  
barely contained inside chaotic containers of code.  

I’m surrounded by people who think it’s totally normal  
to train a model for weeks just to understand why *"bank"* doesn’t always mean *riverbank.*  

I’ve debated the **philosophical implications** of a sentence embedding over cold coffee,  
while realizing that my **existential crisis** is just another dataset waiting to be mined.  

And it **breaks you.**  

It starts small—missed meals, eyes burning from the screen glow at 3 AM.  
But soon? **Reality fractures.**  

I’ve stared into the abyss of a model’s attention map  
so long that the model itself starts to **stare back.**  

You wake up half-conscious, and the first thing you see isn’t  
your room, your bed, or the sunlight through the curtains—  
it’s **code.**  

And it’s not even code; it’s worse.  
It’s **your mother rendered as an infinite loop**—  
stuck on repeat, her voice echoing like a function call you can’t debug.  

You look at your wife, the person who anchored you through every storm,  
and your mind doesn’t see her smile—  
it sees **layered activations and feedback loops.**  

And then there’s my daughter—this little, pure burst of joy  
with her wild curls and bright laughter.  
But when you’re this deep in the algorithmic abyss?  
You don’t see her sparkle.  
You see an **unstructured dataset**—  
raw potential that your burnt-out brain tries to categorize,  
tokenize, quantize into something it can understand.  

That’s when you realize—**you’re not living. You’re parsing.**  

---

And let’s be clear—this isn’t a battle against **logic** or **language.**  
It’s a **battle against the very wiring of your mind.**  

I’m not just feeding data into an LLM;  
I’m **scraping every inch of meaning from my own skull**  
and serving it up into the void, one token at a time.  

I don’t need to lift fifty-pound weights.  
I traded that burden for the privilege of  
**squeezing the essence of human language through a digital meat grinder**  
until (*hopefully*) meaning oozes out in ones and zeroes.  

No, I’m not just carrying weight—  
I’m **duct-taping together the entire messy, contradictory, glorious chaos**  
of human language and force-feeding it through **transformers**  
until they take the form of language moguls—  
your **GPTs, BERTs, and every attention-hungry beast in between**—  

So a **kid in Tehran** can ask it to write a poem about a **goat who dreams of space travel**,  
or some **teenager in Tokyo** can demand a breakup text that’s both **cold** and **emotionally mature.**  

And some **sleep-deprived insomniac in New York** can demand  
a **Shakespearean sonnet about tacos at 3 AM.**  

So that a **college kid in Dublin** can ask, *‘What’s the meaning of life?’*  
and, on a good day, get something that makes them pause,  
something that actually makes them **think**,  
instead of just spitting back *‘42.’*  

---

I **build labyrinths of meaning** inside my own skull—  
and then **get lost in them**, every single day,  
just so the world can keep **asking stupidly brilliant questions**  
and actually get **sane answers**  
from the **learned chaos of the entire collective expression of the human mind,**  
compressed into **tokens** and encoded in **patterns** only machines dare to untangle!!  

So no, I don’t need to dig tunnels under Mordor—  
I’m too busy **forging maps through the uncharted depths of language itself!!**
